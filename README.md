# hello-world
my first Github repository

Hello Humans!

My name is Lori. I've been learning Python since summer 2015 and R since summer 2016 for my proteomics research project. I realized that I needed a better version control system for my R scripts instead of Rscript1.R , Rscript2.R, Rscript3.R etc. I'm also working on keeping a better bioinformatics notebook. I hope my Github will help other noobs like me.
